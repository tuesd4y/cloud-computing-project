# Project Proposal

## Outline and general idea

The idea of this project is to create a dashboard for deploying routing engines (e.g. [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/)) and visualising their covered area.

Based on the dashboard, users should be able to view which routing engines are currently running, visualise which area they cover and deploy new routing engines based on selecting from a set of possible areas where data is existing.

All deployed routing engines should be shown on a map, such that a user can easily see which areas are already covered and running. Setting up a new routing engine involves three steps: Downloading the street network data, computing the covered area to display in the dashboard, pre-processing the street network data to become a routable graph and deploying the routing engine itself.

We plan on storing the pre-processed street network data on AWS S3 and using Kubernetes to deploy the routing engines.

_disclaimer: this would actually be interesting for using at triply - the company where both Sebastian and Chris work_
